Cross-platform desktop application for low level sound manipulation.

...well, cross-platform some day.

* Low level sound manipulation, simple GUI, native desktop application.

## Windows 10
* Visual Studio 2019
* [Windows Core Audio APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/core-audio-apis-in-windows-vista)
* Ninja?
* mingw?

# Notes
Will be following CMake Cookbook through this project, and maybe some others TBD.
